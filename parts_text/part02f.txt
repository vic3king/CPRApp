VACATIONS

The High Court

2.1
(1) One or more judges of each Division of the High Court shall sit in vacation on such days as the senior judge of that Division may from time to time direct, to hear such cases, claims, matters or applications as require to be immediately or promptly heard and to hear other cases, claims, matters or applications if the senior judge of that Division determines that sittings are necessary for that purpose.
(2) Any party to a claim or matter may at any time apply to the Court for an order that such claim or matter be heard in vacation and, if the Court is satisfied that the claim or matter requires to be immediately or promptly heard, it may make an order accordingly and fix a date for the hearing.
(3) Any judge of the High Court may hear such other cases, claims, matters or applications in vacation as the Court may direct.
2.2 The directions in paragraph 2.1 shall not apply in relation to the trial or hearing of cases, claims, matters or applications outside the Royal Courts of Justice but the senior Presiding Judge of each Circuit, with the concurrence of the Senior Presiding Judge, and the Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster and the Business and Property Court Supervising Judge for Birmingham, Bristol and Wales, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the High Court, may make such arrangements for vacation sittings in the courts for which they are respectively responsible as they think desirable.
2.3
(1) Subject to the discretion of the Judge, any appeal and any application normally made to a Judge may be made in the month of September.
(2) In the month of August, save with the permission of a Judge or under arrangements for vacation sittings in courts outside the Royal Courts of Justice, appeals to a Judge will be limited to the matters set out in paragraph 2.5(1) below, and only applications of real urgency will be dealt with, for example urgent applications in respect of injunctions or for possession under rule 83.13(3).
(3) It is desirable, where this is practical, that applications or appeals are submitted to a Master, District Judge or Judge prior to the hearing of the application or appeal so that they can be marked‘fit for August’ or ‘fit for vacation.’ If they are so marked, then normally the Judge will be prepared to hear the application or appeal in August, if marked ‘fit for August’ or in September if marked ‘fit for vacation’. A request to have the papers so marked should normally be made in writing, briefly setting out the nature of the application or appeal and the reasons why it should be dealt with in August or in September, as the case may be.
