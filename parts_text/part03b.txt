PRACTICE DIRECTION 3B – SANCTIONS FOR NON-PAYMENT OF FEES




This Practice Direction supplements CPR rule 3.7, 3.7A1 and 3.7AA
1 If a claim is struck out under rule 3.7, the court will send notice that it has been struck out to the defendant. If a claim or counterclaim is struck out under rule 3.7A1 or 3.7AA, the court will send notice that it has been struck out to both the claimant and the defendant.
2  In relation to the notice sent out under rule 3.7 or 3.7A1, the notice will also explain the effect of rule 25.10. This provides that any interim injunction will cease to have effect 14 days after the date the claim is struck out under rule 3.7. Paragraph (3) provides that if the claimant applies to reinstate the claim before the interim injunction ceases to have effect, the injunction will continue until the hearing of the application unless the court orders otherwise. If the claimant makes such an application, the defendant will be given notice in the ordinary way under rule 23.4.
