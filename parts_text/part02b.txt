PRACTICE DIRECTION 2B – ALLOCATION OF CASES TO LEVELS OF JUDICIARY




Contents of this Practice Direction

SECTION I – SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION
1.1 Rule 2.4 provides that Judges, Masters and District Judges may exercise any function of the court except where an enactment, rule or practice direction provides otherwise. In respect of proceedings in the High Court, Section II of this Practice Direction sets out the matters over which Masters or District Judges do not have jurisdiction or which they may deal with only on certain conditions. References to Circuit Judges include Recorders and references to Masters and District Judges include Deputies.
1.1A Circuit Judges and District Judges may exercise any jurisdiction conferred on the County Court or on a judge of the County Court. Section III of this Practice Direction sets out the matters that will be allocated to a Circuit Judge as well as those that may, or will normally, be allocated to a District Judge.
1.1B This Practice Direction does not affect jurisdiction conferred by other enactments. Reference should also be made to other relevant Practice Directions (eg, Part 24, paragraph 3 and Part 26, paragraphs 12.1-10). The jurisdiction conferred on Masters and District Judges by this Practice Direction shall be exercised in accordance with directions from time to time provided by the President of the King’s Bench Division, the Chancellor of the High Court, the Presiding Judges, or the Chancery Supervising Judges.
1.1C This Practice Direction is not concerned with family proceedings. It is also not concerned with proceedings in the Family Division except to the extent that such proceedings can be dealt with in the Chancery Division or the Family Division, eg, proceedings under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 or under section 14 of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996. District Judges (including District Judges of the Principal Registry of the Family Division) have jurisdiction to hear such proceedings, subject to any Direction given by the President of the Family Division.
1.2 Masters or District Judges who have jurisdiction to hear a matter or to whom a matter has been allocated, may refer that matter to a Judge instead of dealing with it themselves.
1.3 For the purpose of this Practice Direction, in the County Court—
(a) ‘Circuit Judge’ means, in addition to a Circuit Judge, all judges of the Senior Courts, including retired and deputy judges of those courts, Recorders and Upper Tribunal judges (including the Senior President of Tribunals, Chamber Presidents, deputy Presidents of the Upper Tribunal and deputy judges of the Upper Tribunal, but excluding District Judges and District Judges (Magistrates’ Courts)) and the Judge Advocate General; and
(b) ‘District Judge’ means all other Courts and tribunal judges, and High Court Officers (for example, Masters and Registrars), including deputy or temporary High Court Officers, who are judges of the County Court under section 5 of the County Courts Act 1984.
