PRACTICE DIRECTION 3C – CIVIL RESTRAINT ORDERS




This practice direction supplements CPR rule 3.11
Contents of this Practice Direction

Introduction
1 This practice direction applies where the court is considering whether to make –
(a) a limited civil restraint order;
(b) an extended civil restraint order; or
(c) a general civil restraint order,
against a party who has issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.
Rules 3.3(9), 3.4(6) and 23.12 provide that where a statement of case or application is struck out or dismissed and is totally without merit, the court order must specify that fact and the court must consider whether to make a civil restraint order. Rule 52.20(6) makes similar provision where the appeal court refuses an application for permission to appeal, strikes out an appellant’s notice or dismisses an appeal.
