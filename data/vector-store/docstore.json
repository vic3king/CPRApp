      "pageContent": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 1A – PARTICIPATION OF VULNERABLE PARTIES OR WITNESSES\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability\n1. The overriding objective requires that, in order to deal with a case justly, the court should ensure, so far as practicable, that the parties are on an equal footing and can participate fully in proceedings, and that parties and witnesses can give their best evidence. The parties are required to help the court to further the overriding objective at all stages of civil proceedings.\n2. Vulnerability of a party or witness may impede participation and also diminish the quality of evidence. The court should take all proportionate measures to address these issues in every case.\n3. A person should be considered as vulnerable when a factor – which could be personal or situational, permanent or temporary – may adversely affect their participation in proceedings or the giving of evidence.\n4. Factors which may cause vulnerability in a party or witness include (but are not limited to)—\n(a) Age, immaturity or lack of understanding;\n(b) Communication or language difficulties (including literacy);\n(c) Physical disability or impairment, or health condition;\n(d) Mental health condition or significant impairment of any aspect of their intelligence or social functioning (including learning difficulties);\n(e) The impact on them of the subject matter of, or facts relevant to, the case (an example being having witnessed a traumatic event relating to the case);\n(f) Their relationship with a party or witness (examples being sexual assault, domestic abuse or intimidation (actual or perceived));\n(g) Social, domestic or cultural circumstances.\n5. When considering whether a factor may adversely affect the ability of a party or witness to participate in proceedings and/or give evidence, the court should consider their ability to—\n(a) understand the proceedings and their role in them;\n(b) express themselves throughout the proceedings;\n(c) put their evidence before the court;\n(d) respond to or comply with any request of the court, or do so in a timely manner;\n(e) instruct their representative/s (if any) before, during and after the hearing; and\n(f) attend any hearing.\n6. The court, with the assistance of the parties, should try to identify vulnerability of parties or witnesses at the earliest possible stage of proceedings and to consider whether a party’s participation in the proceedings, or the quality of evidence given by a party or witness, is likely to be diminished by reason of vulnerability and, if so, whether it is necessary to make directions as a result.\n7. If the court decides that a party’s or witness’s ability to participate fully and/or give best evidence is likely to be diminished by reason of vulnerability, the court may identify the nature of the vulnerability in an order and may order appropriate provisions to be made to further the overriding objective. This may include concealing the address and/or contact details of either party or a witness for appropriate reasons.\n8. Subject to the nature of any vulnerability having been identified and appropriate provisions having been made, the court should consider ordering ground rules before a vulnerable person is to give evidence, to determine what directions are necessary in relation to—\n(a) the nature and extent of that evidence;\n(b) the conduct of the advocates and/or the parties in respect of the evidence of that person;\n(c) whether one or more special measures and/or any other support should be put in place for that person;\n(d) any duty or power of the court under any enactment or its inherent jurisdiction to prohibit, limit or modify cross-examination of or by a vulnerable witness or to appoint a legal representative to conduct a cross-examination.\n9. Before ordering any ground rules, special measures or other support, the court must consider views expressed by a party or witness about participating in the proceedings or giving evidence\n \nSpecial Measures\n10. Special measures may include, but are not limited to:\n(a) preventing a party or witness from seeing another party or witness by the use of screens;\n(b) allowing a party or witness to give evidence remotely by video conference;\n(c) hearing a party or witness’s evidence in private;\n(d) dispensing with the wearing of wigs and gowns;\n(e) admitting pre-recorded video evidence;\n(f) questioning a party or witness through an intermediary; and\n(g) using a device or other aid to help a party or witness communicate.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated: Tuesday, 31 May 2022",

      "pageContent": "SECTION I – SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION\n1.1 Rule 2.4 provides that Judges, Masters and District Judges may exercise any function of the court except where an enactment, rule or practice direction provides otherwise. In respect of proceedings in the High Court, Section II of this Practice Direction sets out the matters over which Masters or District Judges do not have jurisdiction or which they may deal with only on certain conditions. References to Circuit Judges include Recorders and references to Masters and District Judges include Deputies.\n1.1A Circuit Judges and District Judges may exercise any jurisdiction conferred on the County Court or on a judge of the County Court. Section III of this Practice Direction sets out the matters that will be allocated to a Circuit Judge as well as those that may, or will normally, be allocated to a District Judge.\n1.1B This Practice Direction does not affect jurisdiction conferred by other enactments. Reference should also be made to other relevant Practice Directions (eg, Part 24, paragraph 3 and Part 26, paragraphs 12.1-10). The jurisdiction conferred on Masters and District Judges by this Practice Direction shall be exercised in accordance with directions from time to time provided by the President of the King’s Bench Division, the Chancellor of the High Court, the Presiding Judges, or the Chancery Supervising Judges.\n1.1C This Practice Direction is not concerned with family proceedings. It is also not concerned with proceedings in the Family Division except to the extent that such proceedings can be dealt with in the Chancery Division or the Family Division, eg, proceedings under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 or under section 14 of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996. District Judges (including District Judges of the Principal Registry of the Family Division) have jurisdiction to hear such proceedings, subject to any Direction given by the President of the Family Division.\n1.2 Masters or District Judges who have jurisdiction to hear a matter or to whom a matter has been allocated, may refer that matter to a Judge instead of dealing with it themselves.\n1.3 For the purpose of this Practice Direction, in the County Court—\n(a) ‘Circuit Judge’ means, in addition to a Circuit Judge, all judges of the Senior Courts, including retired and deputy judges of those courts, Recorders and Upper Tribunal judges (including the Senior President of Tribunals, Chamber Presidents, deputy Presidents of the Upper Tribunal and deputy judges of the Upper Tribunal, but excluding District Judges and District Judges (Magistrates’ Courts)) and the Judge Advocate General; and\n(b) ‘District Judge’ means all other Courts and tribunal judges, and High Court Officers (for example, Masters and Registrars), including deputy or temporary High Court Officers, who are judges of the County Court under section 5 of the County Courts Act 1984.\nTo the top\nSECTION II – THE HIGH COURT\nInjunctions, Pre-trial Orders and Interim Remedies\n2. Search orders (rule 25.1(1)(h)), freezing orders (rule 25.1(1)(f)) and an ancillary order under rule 25.1(1)(g) may only be made by a Judge.\n3.1 A Master or District Judge may not make orders or grant interim remedies-\n(a) relating to the liberty of the subject;\n(b) relating to criminal proceedings or matters except procedural applications in appeals to the High Court (including appeals by case stated) under any enactment;\n(c) relating to a claim for judicial review, except that interim applications in claims for judicial review may be made to Masters of the King’s Bench Division;\n(d) relating to appeals from Masters or District Judges;\n(e) in appeals against costs assessment under Parts 44 to 47, except on an appeal under rule 47.21 against the decision of an authorised court officer;\n(f) in applications under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 by a person subject to a Civil or a Criminal or an All Proceedings Order (vexatious litigant) for permission to start or continue proceedings; or\ng) in applications under section 139 of the Mental Health Act 1983 for permission to bring proceedings against a person.\n3.1A Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3.1 a Master of the Crown Office or a Master of the Administrative Court may–\n(a) make orders and grant interim remedies relating to claims for judicial review (including claims for judicial review relating to criminal causes, appeals under the Extradition Act 2003 and applications to vary bail conditions, provided the prosecutor does not oppose the variation);\n(b) determine liability for costs and make summary assessments of costs in relation to claims for judicial review; and\n(c) make orders and grant interim remedies relating to applications under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 for permission to start or continue claims for judicial review.\nTo the top\nEarly Trials\n4.1 A Master or District Judge may only give directions for early trial after consulting the Head of the relevant Division or a Judge nominated by the Head of Division.\nTo the top\nAssignment of Claims to Masters and Transfer between Masters\n6.1 The Senior Master and the Chief Master will make arrangements for proceedings to be assigned to individual Masters. They may vary such arrangements generally or in particular cases, for example, by transferring a case from a Master to whom it had been assigned to another Master.\n6.2 The fact that a case has been assigned to a particular Master does not prevent another Master from dealing with that case if circumstances require, whether at the request of the assigned Master or otherwise.\nTo the top\nFreezing Orders: Cross Examination of Deponents about Assets\n7 Where the court has made a freezing order under rule 25.1(f) and has ordered a person to make a witness statement or affidavit about his assets and to be cross-examined on its contents, unless the Judge directs otherwise, the cross-examination will take place before a Master or a District Judge, or if the Master or District Judge directs, before an examiner of the Court.\nTo the top\nHuman Rights\n7A A deputy High Court Judge, a Master or District Judge may not try –\n(1) a case in a claim made in respect of a judicial act under the Human Rights Act 1998, or\n(2) a claim for a declaration of incompatibility in accordance with section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998.\nTo the top\nChancery Proceedings\n7B.1 In proceedings in the Chancery Division, a Master may not deal with the following without the consent of the Chancellor of the High Court–\n(a) granting an indemnity for costs out of the assets of a company on the application of minority shareholders bringing a derivative action; or\n(b) making orders in proceedings in the Patents Court except–\n(i) orders by way of settlement, except settlement of procedural disputes;\n(ii) applications for extension of time;\n(iii) applications for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction;\n(iv) applications for security for costs;\n(v) other matters as directed by a judge of the court; and\n(vi) enforcement of money judgments.\n7B.2 In proceedings in the Chancery Division, a District Judge may not deal with the following without the consent of the Supervising Judge for the region in which the District Judge is sitting, or without the consent of their nominee–\n(a) approving compromises (other than applications under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975) (i) on behalf of a person under disability where that person’s interest in a fund, or if there is no fund, the maximum amount of the claim, exceeds £100,000 or any larger sum specified by the Chancellor of the High Court and (ii) on behalf of absent, unborn and unascertained persons;\n(b) making final orders under section 1(1) of the Variation of Trusts Act 1958, except for the removal of protective trusts where the interest of the principal beneficiary has not failed or determined;",

A request to have the papers so marked should normally be made in writing, briefly setting out the nature of the application or appeal and the reasons why it should be dealt with in August or in September, as the case may be.\nTo the top\n\nChancery Masters\n\n2.4 There is no distinction between term time and vacation so far as business before the Chancery Masters is concerned. The Masters will deal with all types of business throughout the year, and when a Master is on holiday his list will normally be taken by a Deputy Master.\nTo the top\n\nKing’s Bench Masters\n\n2.5\n(1) An application notice may, without permission, be made to a Master in the month of August for any of the following purposes:\nto set aside a claim form or particulars of claim, or service of a claim form or particulars of claim;\nto set aside judgment; for stay of execution;\nfor any order by consent;\nfor judgment or permission to enter judgment;\nfor approval of settlements or for interim payment;\nfor relief from forfeiture; for charging order; for third party debtor order;\nfor appointment or discharge of a receiver;\nfor relief by way of interpleader by a sheriff or High Court enforcement officer;\nfor transfer to a county court or for trial by Master;\nfor time where time is running in the month of August;\n(2) In any case of urgency any other type of application notice (that is other than those for the purposes in (1) above), may, with the permission of a Master be made to a Master during the month of August.\nTo the top\n\n\n\n\nUpdated: Tuesday, 7 February 2023",

or\n(b) where the claim is commenced on or after 22nd April 2014 and is for a monetary claim which is not quantified or not fully quantified or is for a non-monetary claim and in any such case the claim form contains a statement that the claim is valued at £10 million or more; or\n(c) where in proceedings commenced on or after 6th April 2016 a claim is made by or on behalf of a person under the age of 18 (a child) (and on a child reaching majority this exception will continue to apply unless the court otherwise orders); or (d) where the proceeding are the subject of fixed costs or scale costs; or (e) the court otherwise orders.\n(1A) This Section and Practice Direction 3D will apply to any other proceedings (including applications) where the court so orders.\n(2) The purpose of costs management is that the court should manage both the steps to be taken and the costs to be incurred by the parties to any proceedings (or variation costs as provided in rule 3.15A) so as to further the overriding objective.\nTo the top\nFiling and exchanging budgets and budget discussion reports\n3.13\n(1) Unless the court otherwise orders, all parties except litigants in person must file and exchange budgets—\n(a) where the stated value of the claim on the claim form is less than £50,000, with their directions questionnaires; or\n(b) in any other case, not later than 21 days before the first case management conference.\n(2) In the event that a party files and exchanges a budget under paragraph (1), all other parties, not being litigants in person, must file an agreed budget discussion report no later than 7 days before the first case management conference.\n(3) The court—\n(a) may, on its own initiative or on application, order the parties to file and exchange costs budgets in a case where the parties are not otherwise required by this Section to do so;\n(b) shall (other than in an exceptional case) make an order to file and exchange costs budgets if all parties consent to an application for such an order.\n(4) The court may, in a substantial case, direct that budgets are to be limited in the first instance to part only of the proceedings and extended later to cover the whole proceedings.\n(5) Every budget must be dated and verified by a statement of truth signed by a senior legal representative of the party.\n(6) Even though a litigant in person is not required to prepare a budget, each other party (other than a litigant in person) must provide the litigant in person with a copy of that party’s budget.\nFailure to file a budget\n3.14 Unless the court otherwise orders, any party which fails to file a budget despite being required to do so will be treated as having filed a budget comprising only the applicable court fees.\nTo the top\nCosts management orders\n3.15\n(1) In addition to exercising its other powers, the court may manage the costs to be incurred (the budgeted costs) by any party in any proceedings.\n(2) The court may at any time make a ‘costs management order’. Where costs budgets have been filed and exchanged the court will make a costs management order unless it is satisfied that the litigation can be conducted justly and at proportionate cost in accordance with the overriding objective without such an order being made. By a costs management order the court will—\n(a) record the extent to which the budgeted costs are agreed between the parties;\n(b) in respect of the budgeted costs which are not agreed, record the court’s approval after making appropriate revisions;\n(c) record the extent (if any) to which incurred costs are agreed.\n(3) If a costs management order has been made, the court will thereafter control the parties’ budgets in respect of recoverable costs.\n(4) Whether or not the court makes a costs management order, it may record on the face of any case management order any comments it has about the incurred costs which are to be taken into account in any subsequent assessment proceedings.\n(5) Save in exceptional circumstances—\n(a )the recoverable costs of initially completing Precedent H (the form to be used for a costs budget) shall not exceed the higher of—\n(i) £1,000; or\n(ii) 1% of the total of the incurred costs (as agreed or allowed on assessment) and the budgeted costs (agreed or approved); and\n(b) all other recoverable costs of the budgeting and costs management process shall not exceed 2% of the total of the incurred costs (as agreed or allowed on assessment) and the budgeted (agreed or approved) costs.\n(Precedent H is annexed to Practice Direction 3D.)\n(6) The court may set a timetable or give other directions for future reviews of budgets.\n(7) After a party’s budgeted costs have been approved or agreed, the party must re-file and re-serve the budget—\n(a) in the form approved or agreed with re-cast figures; and\n(b) annexed to the order approving the budgeted costs or recording the parties’ agreement.\n(8) A costs management order concerns the totals allowed for each phase of the budget, and while the underlying detail in the budget for each phase used by the party to calculate the totals claimed is provided for reference purposes to assist the court in fixing a budget, it is not the role of the court in the costs management hearing to fix or approve the hourly rates claimed in the budget.",

or\n(ii) 1% of the total of the incurred costs (as agreed or allowed on assessment) and the budgeted costs (agreed or approved); and\n(b) all other recoverable costs of the budgeting and costs management process shall not exceed 2% of the total of the incurred costs (as agreed or allowed on assessment) and the budgeted (agreed or approved) costs.\n(Precedent H is annexed to Practice Direction 3D.)\n(6) The court may set a timetable or give other directions for future reviews of budgets.\n(7) After a party’s budgeted costs have been approved or agreed, the party must re-file and re-serve the budget—\n(a) in the form approved or agreed with re-cast figures; and\n(b) annexed to the order approving the budgeted costs or recording the parties’ agreement.\n(8) A costs management order concerns the totals allowed for each phase of the budget, and while the underlying detail in the budget for each phase used by the party to calculate the totals claimed is provided for reference purposes to assist the court in fixing a budget, it is not the role of the court in the costs management hearing to fix or approve the hourly rates claimed in the budget.\nRevision and variation of costs budgets on account of significant developments (“variation costs”)\n3.15A.\n(1) A party (“the revising party”) must revise its budgeted costs upwards or downwards if significant developments in the litigation warrant such revisions.\n(2) Any budgets revised in accordance with paragraph (1) must be submitted promptly by the revising party to the other parties for agreement, and subsequently to the court, in accordance with paragraphs (3) to (5).\n(3) The revising party must—\n(a) serve particulars of the variation proposed on every other party, using the form prescribed by Practice Direction 3D;\n(b) confine the particulars to the additional costs occasioned by the significant development; and\n(c) certify, in the form prescribed by Practice Direction 3D, that the additional costs are not included in any previous budgeted costs or variation.\n(4) The revising party must submit the particulars of variation promptly to the court, together with the last approved or agreed budget, and with an explanation of the points of difference if they have not been agreed.\n(5) The court may approve, vary or disallow the proposed variations, having regard to any significant developments which have occurred since the date when the previous budget was approved or agreed, or may list a further costs management hearing.\n(6) Where the court makes an order for variation, it may vary the budget for costs related to that variation which have been incurred prior to the order for variation but after the costs management order.\nTo the top\nCosts management conferences\n3.16\n(1) Any hearing which is convened solely for the purpose of costs management (for example, to approve a revised budget) is referred to as a ‘costs management conference’.\n(2) Where practicable, costs management conferences should be conducted by telephone or in writing.\nCourt to have regard to budgets and to take account of costs\n3.17\n(1) When making any case management decision, the court will have regard to any available budgets of the parties and will take into account the costs involved in each procedural step.\n(2) Paragraph (1) applies whether or not the court has made a costs management order.\n(3) Subject to rule 3.15A, the court—\n(a) may not approve costs incurred up to and including the date of any costs management hearing; but\n(b) may record its comments on those costs and take those costs into account when considering the reasonableness and proportionality of all budgeted costs.\n(4) If an interim application is made but is not included in a budget, the court may, if it considers it reasonable not to have included the application in the budget, treat the costs of such interim application as additional to the approved budgets.\nTo the top\nAssessing costs on the standard basis where a costs management order has been made\n3.18 In any case where a costs management order has been made, when assessing costs on the standard basis, the court will –\n(a) have regard to the receiving party’s last approved or agreed budgeted costs for each phase of the proceedings;\n(b) not depart from such approved or agreed budgeted costs unless satisfied that there is good reason to do so; and\n(c) take into account any comments made pursuant to rule 3.17(3) and recorded on the face of the order.\n(Attention is drawn to rules 44.3(2)(a) and 44.3(5), which concern proportionality of costs.)\nTo the top\nIII COSTS CAPPING\nCosts capping orders – General\n3.19\n(1) For the purposes of this Section—\n(a) ‘costs capping order’ means an order limiting the amount of future costs (including disbursements) which a party may recover pursuant to an order for costs subsequently made; and\n(b) ‘future costs’ means costs incurred in respect of work done after the date of the costs capping order but excluding the amount of any additional liability. (2) This Section does not apply to judicial review costs capping orders under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 or to protective costs orders. (Rules 46.16 to 46.19 make provision for judicial review costs capping orders under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015.)\n(3) Omitted.\n(4) A costs capping order may be in respect of –\n(a) the whole litigation; or\n(b) any issues which are ordered to be tried separately.\n(5) The court may at any stage of proceedings make a costs capping order against all or any of the parties, if –\n(a) it is in the interests of justice to do so;\n(b) there is a substantial risk that without such an order costs will be disproportionately incurred; and\n(c) it is not satisfied that the risk in subparagraph (b) can be adequately controlled by –\n(i) case management directions or orders made under this Part; and\n(ii) detailed assessment of costs.\n(6) In considering whether to exercise its discretion under this rule, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including –\n(a) whether there is a substantial imbalance between the financial position of the parties;\n(b) whether the costs of determining the amount of the cap are likely to be proportionate to the overall costs of the litigation;\n(c) the stage which the proceedings have reached; and\n(d) the costs which have been incurred to date and the future costs.\n(7) A costs capping order, once made, will limit the costs recoverable by the party subject to the order unless a party successfully applies to vary the order. No such variation will be made unless –\n(a) there has been a material and substantial change of circumstances since the date when the order was made; or\n(b) there is some other compelling reason why a variation should be made.\nTo the top\nApplication for a costs capping order\n3.20\n(1) An application for a costs capping order must be made on notice in accordance with Part 23.\n(2) The application notice must –\n(a) set out –\n(i) whether the costs capping order is in respect of the whole of the litigation or a particular issue which is ordered to be tried separately; and\n(ii) why a costs capping order should be made; and\n(b) be accompanied by a budget setting out –\n(i) the costs (and disbursements) incurred by the applicant to date; and\n(ii) the costs (and disbursements) which the applicant is likely to incur in the future conduct of the proceedings.\n(3) The court may give directions for the determination of the application and such directions may –\n(a) direct any party to the proceedings –",

      "pageContent": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 3A – STRIKING OUT A STATEMENT OF CASE\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Rule 3.4\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nIntroductory\n1.1 This practice direction sets out the procedure a party should follow if they wish to make an application for an order under rule 3.4(2)(a) (where a statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a claim); or under rule 3.4(2)(b) (where a statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings).\n1.2 The following are examples of cases where the court may conclude that particulars of claim (whether contained in a claim form or filed separately) fall within rule 3.4(2)(a): (1) those which set out no facts indicating what the claim is about, for example ‘Money owed £5000’, (2) those which are incoherent and make no sense, (3) those which contain a coherent set of facts but those facts, even if true, do not disclose any legally recognisable claim against the defendant.\n1.3 A claim may fall within rule 3.4(2)(b) where it is vexatious, scurrilous or obviously ill-founded.\n1.4 A defence may fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) where: (1) it consists of a bare denial or otherwise sets out no coherent statement of facts, or (2) the facts it sets out, while coherent, would not  amount in law to a defence to the claim even if true.\n1.5 A party may believe they can show without a trial that an opponent’s case has no real prospect of success on the facts, or that the case is bound to succeed or fail, as the case may be, because of a point of law (including the interpretation of a document). In such a case the party concerned may make an application under rule 3.4 or apply for summary judgment under Part 24 (or both) as they think appropriate.\n1.6 Where a rule, practice direction or order states ‘shall be struck out or dismissed’ or ‘will be struck out or dismissed’ this means that the striking out or dismissal will be automatic and that no further order of the court is required.\nTo the top\nClaims which appear to fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b)\n2.1 If a court officer is asked to issue a claim form which they believe may fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b) they should issue it, but may then consult a judge (under rule 3.2) before returning the claim form to the claimant or taking any other step to serve the defendant. The judge may on they own initiative make an immediate order designed to ensure that the claim is disposed of or proceeds in a way that accords with the rules.\n2.2 The judge may allow the claimant a hearing before deciding whether to make such an order.\n2.3 Orders the judge may make include: (1) an order that the claim be stayed until further order, (2) an order that the claim form be retained by the court and not served until the stay is lifted, (3) an order that no application by the claimant to lift the stay be heard unless they file such further documents (for example a witness statement or an amended claim form or particulars of claim) as may be specified in the order.\n2.4 Where the judge makes any such order or, subsequently, an order lifting the stay they may give directions about the service on the defendant of the order and any other documents on the court file.\n2.5 The fact that a judge allows a claim referred to them by a court officer to proceed does not prejudice the right of any party to apply for any order against the claimant.\nTo the top\nDefences which appear to fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b)\n3.1 A court officer may similarly consult a judge about any document filed which purports to be a defence and which he believes may fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b).\n3.2 If the judge decides that the document falls within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b) they may on their own initiative make an order striking it out. Where they do so they may extend the time for the defendant to file a proper defence.\n3.3 The judge may allow the defendant a hearing before deciding whether to make such an order.\n3.4 Alternatively the judge may make an order under rule 18.1 requiring the defendant within a stated time to clarify his defence or to give additional information about it. The order may provide that the defence will be struck out if the defendant does not comply.\n3.5 The fact that a judge does not strike out a defence on their own initiative does not prejudice the right of the claimant to apply for any order against the defendant.\nTo the top\nGeneral provisions\n4.1 The court may exercise its powers under rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b) on application or on its own initiative at any time.\n4.2 Where a judge at a hearing strikes out all or part of a party’s statement of case he may enter such judgment for the other party as that party appears entitled to.\nTo the top\nApplications for orders under rule 3.4(2)\n5.1 Attention is drawn to Part 23 (General Rules about Applications) and to Practice Direction 23A. The practice direction requires all applications to be made as soon as possible and before allocation if possible.\n5.2 While many applications under rule 3.4(2) can be made without evidence in support, the applicant should consider whether facts need to be proved and, if so, whether evidence in support should be filed and served.\nTo the top\nApplications for summary judgment\n6.1 Applications for summary judgment may be made under Part 24. Attention is drawn to that Part and to Practice Direction 24.\nTo the top\n\n\n\n\nUpdated: Saturday, 1 October 2022",

If a claim or counterclaim is struck out under rule 3.7A1 or 3.7AA, the court will send notice that it has been struck out to both the claimant and the defendant.\n2  In relation to the notice sent out under rule 3.7 or 3.7A1, the notice will also explain the effect of rule 25.10. This provides that any interim injunction will cease to have effect 14 days after the date the claim is struck out under rule 3.7. Paragraph (3) provides that if the claimant applies to reinstate the claim before the interim injunction ceases to have effect, the injunction will continue until the hearing of the application unless the court orders otherwise.

      "pageContent": "Introduction\n1 This practice direction applies where the court is considering whether to make –\n(a) a limited civil restraint order;\n(b) an extended civil restraint order; or\n(c) a general civil restraint order,\nagainst a party who has issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.\nRules 3.3(9), 3.4(6) and 23.12 provide that where a statement of case or application is struck out or dismissed and is totally without merit, the court order must specify that fact and the court must consider whether to make a civil restraint order. Rule 52.20(6) makes similar provision where the appeal court refuses an application for permission to appeal, strikes out an appellant’s notice or dismisses an appeal.\nTo the top\nLimited civil restraint orders\n2.1 A limited civil restraint order may be made by a judge of any court where a party has made 2 or more applications which are totally without merit.\n2.2 Where the court makes a limited civil restraint order, the party against whom the order is made –\n(1) will be restrained from making any further applications in the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order;\n(2) may apply for amendment or discharge of the order provided he has first obtained the permission of a judge identified in the order; and\n(3) may apply for permission to appeal the order and if permission is granted, may appeal the order.\n2.3 Where a party who is subject to a limited civil restraint order –\n(1) makes a further application in the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order, such application will automatically be dismissed –\n(a) without the judge having to make any further order; and\n(b) without the need for the other party to respond to it;\n(2) repeatedly makes applications for permission pursuant to that order which are totally without merit, the court may direct that if the party makes any further application for permission which is totally without merit, the decision to dismiss the application will be final and there will be no right of appeal, unless the judge who refused permission grants permission to appeal.\n2.4 A party who is subject to a limited civil restraint order may not make an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) without first serving notice of the application on the other party in accordance with paragraph 2.5.\n2.5 A notice under paragraph 2.4 must –\n(1) set out the nature and grounds of the application; and\n(2) provide the other party with at least 7 days within which to respond.\n2.6 An application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) –\n(1) must be made in writing;\n(2) must include the other party’s written response, if any, to the notice served under paragraph 2.4; and\n(3) will be determined without a hearing.\n2.7 An order under paragraph 2.3(2) may only be made by –\n(1) a Court of Appeal judge;\n(2) a High Court judge or Master; or\n(3) a Designated Civil Judge or their appointed deputy.\n2.8 Where a party makes an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) and permission is refused, any application for permission to appeal –\n(1) must be made in writing; and\n(2) will be determined without a hearing.\n2.9 A limited civil restraint order –\n(1) is limited to the particular proceedings in which it is made;\n(2) will remain in effect for the duration of the proceedings in which it is made, unless the court otherwise orders; and\n(3) must identify the judge or judges to whom an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1), 2.2(2) or 2.8 should be made.\nTo the top\nExtended civil restraint orders\n3.1 An extended civil restraint order may be made by –\n(1) a judge of the Court of Appeal;\n(2) a judge of the High Court; or\n(3) a Designated Civil Judge or their appointed deputy in the County Court, where a party has persistently issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.\n3.2 Unless the court otherwise orders, where the court makes an extended civil restraint order, the party against whom the order is made –\n(1) will be restrained from issuing claims or making applications in –\n(a) any court if the order has been made by a judge of the Court of Appeal;\n(b) the High Court or the County Court if the order has been made by a judge of the High Court; or\n(c) the County Court if the order has been made by a designated civil judge or their appointed deputy, concerning any matter involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order;\n(2) may apply for amendment or discharge of the order provided he has first obtained the permission of a judge identified in the order; and\n(3) may apply for permission to appeal the order and if permission is granted, may appeal the order.\n3.3 Where a party who is subject to an extended civil restraint order –\n(1) issues a claim or makes an application in a court identified in the order concerning any matter involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order, the claim or application will automatically be struck out or dismissed –\n(a) without the judge having to make any further order; and\n(b) without the need for the other party to respond to it;\n(2) repeatedly makes applications for permission pursuant to that order which are totally without merit, the court may direct that if the party makes any further application for permission which is totally without merit, the decision to dismiss the application will be final and there will be no right of appeal, unless the judge who refused permission grants permission to appeal.\n3.4 A party who is subject to an extended civil restraint order may not make an application for permission under paragraphs 3.2(1) or 3.2(2) without first serving notice of the application on the other party in accordance with paragraph 3.5.\n3.5 A notice under paragraph 3.4 must –\n(1) set out the nature and grounds of the application; and\n(2) provide the other party with at least 7 days within which to respond.\n3.6 An application for permission under paragraphs 3.2(1) or 3.2(2) –\n(1) must be made in writing;\n(2) must include the other party’s written response, if any, to the notice served under paragraph 3.4; and\n(3) will be determined without a hearing.\n3.7 An order under paragraph 3.3(2) may only be made by –\n(1) a Court of Appeal judge;\n(2) a High Court judge; or\n(3) a Designated Civil Judge or their appointed deputy.\n3.8 Where a party makes an application for permission under paragraphs 3.2(1) or 3.2(2) and permission is refused, any application for permission to appeal –\n(1) must be made in writing; and\n(2) will be determined without a hearing.\n3.9 An extended civil restraint order –\n(1) will be made for a specified period not exceeding 3 years;\n(2) must identify the courts in which the party against whom the order is made is restrained from issuing claims or making applications; and\n(3) must identify the judge or judges to whom an application for permission under paragraphs 3.2(1), 3.2(2) or 3.8 should be made.\n3.10 The court may extend the duration of an extended civil restraint order, if it considers it appropriate to do so, but it must not be extended for a period greater than 3 years on any given occasion.\n3.11 If they consider that it would be appropriate to make an extended civil restraint order –\n(1) a Master or a District Judge in a district registry of the High Court must transfer the proceedings to a High Court judge; and\n(2) a Circuit Judge or a District Judge in the County Court must transfer the proceedings to the Designated Civil Judge.\nTo the top\nGeneral civil restraint orders\n4.1 A general civil restraint order may be made by –\n(1) a judge of the Court of Appeal;\n(2) a judge of the High Court;

      "pageContent": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 3D – COSTS MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 3\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n\nA. Production of Costs Budgets\n1.  In cases where the Claimant has a limited or severely impaired life expectation (5 years or less remaining) the court will ordinarily disapply cost management under Section II of Part 3.\n2. An order for the provision of costs budgets with a view to a costs management order being made may be particularly appropriate in the following cases—\n(a)    unfair prejudice petitions under section 994 of the Companies Act 2006;\n(b)    disqualification proceedings pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986;\n(c)    applications under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996;\n(d)    claims pursuant to the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975;\n(e)    any Part 8 or other claims or applications involving a substantial dispute of fact and/or likely to require oral evidence and/or extensive disclosure; and\n(f)    personal injury and clinical negligence cases where the value of the claim is £10 million or more.\n \nB. Documents to be lodged for costs budgeting purposes\n3. (a)Save in exceptional circumstances or where the court orders otherwise, the parties are not expected to lodge any documents other than Precedent H and the budget discussion report. Both are annexed, to this practice direction. If the Excel format precedent on the MOJ website is used, the calculation on page one will calculate the totals automatically and the phase totals are linked to this page also.\n(b) Precedent T, also annexed to this practice direction, is to be used in the event of variation of a budget pursuant to rule 3.15A.\nC. Budget format\n4. (a) Unless the court otherwise orders, a budget must be in the form of Precedent H annexed to this Practice Direction. It must be in landscape format with an easily legible typeface.\n(b) In cases where a party’s total costs (incurred and estimated) do not exceed £25,000 or the value of the claim as stated on the claim form is less than £50,000, the parties must only use the first page of Precedent H.\n(The wording for a statement of truth verifying a budget is set out in Practice Direction 22.)\n5. In deciding the reasonable and proportionate costs of each phase of the budget the court will have regard to the factors set out at Civil Procedure Rules 44.3(5) and 44.4(3) including a consideration of where and the circumstances in which the work was done as opposed to where the case is heard.\n6. The table below identifies where within the budget form the various items of work, in so far as they are required by the circumstances of your case, should be included. The time estimated may have to be justified on the budget hearing along with the grade of fee earner doing the work.\n7. Allowance must be made in each phase for advising the client, taking instructions and corresponding with the other party/parties and the court in respect of matters falling within that phase.\n8. The time spent in preparing the budget and associated material must not be claimed in the draft budget under any phase. The maximum figures permitted under rule 3.15(5) should be inserted once the costs budget has been approved by the court.\n9. The ‘contingent cost’ sections of this form should be used for anticipated costs which do not fall within the main categories set out in this form. Examples might be the trial of preliminary issues, applications to amend, applications for disclosure against third parties or (in libel cases) applications re meaning. Costs which are disputed (such as the need for a particular expert) should be set out in the appropriate phase of the budget and if necessary marked as disputed. Only costs which are more likely than not to be incurred should be included.\n(Variation of an approved or agreed budget is dealt with in rule 3.15A.)\nD. Assumptions\n10. (a) The assumptions that are reflected in the table below are not to be repeated. Include only those assumptions that significantly impact on the level of costs claimed such as the duration of the proceedings, the number of experts and witnesses or the number of interim applications envisaged. Brief details only are required in the box beneath each phase. Additional documents should only be prepared in exceptional circumstance and, where they are disregarded by the court, the cost of preparation may be disallowed.\n(b)  Written assumptions are not normally required by the Court in cases where the parties are only required to lodge the first page.\n\nE. Budget discussion reports\n11. The budget discussion report required by rule 3.13(2) must set out—\n(a) those figures which are agreed for each phase;\n(b) those figures which are not agreed for each phase; and\n(c) a brief summary of the grounds of dispute.\nThe parties are encouraged to use the Precedent R Budget Discussion Report annexed to this practice direction.\nF. Costs management orders\n12. When reviewing budgeted costs, the court will not undertake a detailed assessment in advance, but rather will consider whether the budgeted costs fall within the range of reasonable and proportionate costs.\nG.  Oppressive behaviour\n13. Any party may apply to the court if it considers that another party is behaving oppressively in seeking to cause the applicant to spend money disproportionately on costs and the court will grant such relief as may be appropriate.\nAnnexes\nAnnex A Precedent H (xls file – opens in new window)\nAnnex B:  Precedent R\nAnnex C:  Precedent T\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated: Thursday, 24 November 2022",

Regulations as ‘deeds poll’).\n2\n(1) A person seeking to enrol a deed poll (’the applicant’) must be a Commonwealth citizen as defined by section 37(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981.\n(2) If the applicant is a British citizen, a British Dependent Territories citizen or a British Overseas citizen, he must be described as such in the deed poll, which must also specify the section of the British Nationality Act under which the relevant citizenship was acquired.\n(3) In any other case, the applicant must be described as a Commonwealth citizen.\n(4) The applicant must be described in the deed poll as single, married, widowed, divorced, a civil partner or former civil partner and, if a former civil partner, whether the civil partnership ended on death or dissolution.\n3\n(1) As

marriage or civil partnership certificate; and\n(b) show that the notice of his intention to apply for the enrolment of the deed poll had been given to his spouse or civil partner by delivery or by post to his spouse’s or civil partner’s last known address; and\n(c) show that he has obtained the consent of his spouse or civil partner to the proposed change of name or that there is good reason why such consent should be dispensed with.\n4\n(1) The deed poll and the documents referred to in regulation 3 must be exhibited to a statutory declaration by a Commonwealth citizen who is a householder in the United Kingdom and who must declare that he is such in the statutory declaration.\n(2) The statutory declaration must state the period, which should ordinarily not be less than 10 years, during which the householder has known the applicant and must identify the applicant as the person referred to in the documents exhibited to the statutory declaration.\n(3) Where the period mentioned in paragraph (2) is stated to be less than 10 years, the Master of the Rolls may in his absolute discretion decide whether to permit the deed poll to be enrolled and may require the applicant to provide more information before so deciding.\n5 If the applicant is resident outside the United Kingdom, he must provide evidence that such residence is not intended to be permanent and the applicant may be required to produce a certificate by a solicitor as to the nature and probable duration of such residence.\n6 The applicant must sign the deed poll in both his old and new names.\n7 Upon enrolment the deed poll shall be advertised in the London Gazette by the clerk in charge for the time being of the Filing and Record Department at the Central Office of the Supreme Court.\n8\n(1) Subject to the following provisions of this regulation, these Regulations shall apply in relation to a deed poll evidencing the change of name of a child as if the child were the

      "pageContent": "Scope of this Practice Direction\n1.1 This Practice Direction supplements –\n(1) Section II (service of the claim form in the jurisdiction) of Part 6;\n(2) Section III (service of documents other than the claim form in the United Kingdom) of Part 6; and\n(3) rule 6.40 in relation to the method of service on a party in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n(Practice Direction 6B contains provisions relevant to service on a party in Scotland or Northern Ireland, including provisions about service out of the jurisdiction where permission is and is not required and the period for responding to an application notice.)\nTo the top\nWhen service may be by document exchange\n2.1 Service by document exchange (DX) may take place only where –\n(1) the address at which the party is to be served includes a numbered box at a DX, or\n(2) the writing paper of the party who is to be served or of the solicitor acting for that party sets out a DX box number, and\n(3) the party or the solicitor acting for that party has not indicated in writing that they are unwilling to accept service by DX.\nTo the top\nHow service is effected by post, an alternative service provider or DX\n3.1 Service by post, DX or other service which provides for delivery on the next business day is effected by –\n(1) placing the document in a post box;\n(2) leaving the document with or delivering the document to the relevant service provider; or\n(3) having the document collected by the relevant service provider.\nTo the top\nService by fax or other electronic means\n4.1 Subject to the provisions of rule 6.23(5) and (6), where a document is to be served by fax or other electronic means –\n(1) the party who is to be served or the solicitor acting for that party must previously have indicated in writing to the party serving –\n(a) that the party to be served or the solicitor is willing to accept service by fax or other electronic means; and\n(b) the fax number, e-mail address or e-mail addresses or other electronic identification to which it must be sent; and\n(2) the following are to be taken as sufficient written indications for the purposes of paragraph 4.1(1) –\n(a) a fax number set out on the writing paper of the solicitor acting for the party to be served;\n(b) an e-mail address or e-mail addresses set out on the writing paper of the solicitor acting for the party to be served but only where it is stated that the e-mail address or e-mail addresses may be used for service; or\n(c) a fax number, e-mail address or e-mail addresses or electronic identification set out on a statement of case or a response to a claim filed with the court.\n(3) Where a party has indicated that service by email must be effected by sending a document to multiple e-mail addresses, the document may be served by sending it to any 2 of the e-mail addresses identified.\n4.2 Where a party intends to serve a document by electronic means (other than by fax) that party must first ask the party who is to be served whether there are any limitations to the recipient’s agreement to accept service by such means (for example, the format in which documents are to be sent and the maximum size of attachments that may be received).\n4.3 Where a document is served by electronic means, the party serving the document need not in addition send or deliver a hard copy.\nTo the top\nService on members of the Regular Forces and United States Air Force\n5.1 The provisions that apply to service on members of the regular forces (within the meaning of the Armed Forces Act 2006) and members of the United States Air Force are annexed to this practice direction.\nTo the top\nPersonal service on a company or other corporation\n6.1 Personal service on a registered company or corporation in accordance with rule 6.5(3) is effected by leaving a document with a person holding a senior position.\n6.2 Each of the following persons is a person holding a senior position –\n(1) in respect of a registered company or corporation, a director, the treasurer, the secretary of the company or corporation, the chief executive, a manager or other officer of the company or corporation; and\n(2) in respect of a corporation which is not a registered company, in addition to any of the persons set out in sub-paragraph (1), the mayor, the chairman, the president, a town clerk or similar officer of the corporation.\nTo the top\nCertificate of service where claimant serves the claim form\n7.1 Where, pursuant to rule 6.17(2), the claimant files a certificate of service, the claimant is not required to and should not file –\n(1) a further copy of the claim form with the certificate of service; and\n(2) a further copy of –\n(a) the particulars of claim (where not included in the claim form); or\n(b) any document attached to the particulars of claim,\nwith the certificate of service where that document has already been filed with the court.\n(Rule 7.4 requires the claimant to file a copy of the particulars of claim (where served separately from the claim form) within 7 days of service on the defendant.)\nTo the top\nService by the court\n8.1 Where the court serves a document in accordance with rule 6.4 or 6.21(2), the method will normally be first class post.\nTo the top\nApplication for an order for service by an alternative method or at an alternative place\n9.1 Where an application for an order under rule 6.15 is made before the document is served, the application must be supported by evidence stating –\n(1) the reason why an order is sought;\n(2) what alternative method or place is proposed, and\n(3) why the applicant believes that the document is likely to reach the person to be served by the method or at the place proposed.\n9.2 Where the application for an order is made after the applicant has taken steps to bring the document to the attention of the person to be served by an alternative method or at an alternative place, the application must be supported by evidence stating –\n(1) the reason why the order is sought;\n(2) what alternative method or alternative place was used;\n(3) when the alternative method or place was used; and\n(4) why the applicant believes that the document is likely to have reached the person to be served by the alternative method or at the alternative place.\n9.3 Examples –\n(1) an application to serve by posting or delivering to an address of a person who knows the other party must be supported by evidence that if posted or delivered to that address, the document is likely to be brought to the attention of the other party;\n(2) an application to serve by sending a SMS text message or leaving a voicemail message at a particular telephone number saying where the document is must be accompanied by evidence that the person serving the document has taken, or will take, appropriate steps to ensure that the party being served is using that telephone number and is likely to receive the message; and\n(3) an application to serve by e-mail to a company (where paragraph 4.1 does not apply) must be supported by evidence that the e-mail address to which the document will be sent is one which is likely to come to the attention of a person holding a senior position in that company.\nTo the top\nDeemed service of a document other than a claim form\n10.1 Rule 6.26 contains provisions about deemed service of a document other than a claim form. Examples of how deemed service is calculated are set out below.\n10.2\nExample 1\nWhere the document is posted (by first class post) on a Monday (a business day), the day of deemed service is the following Wednesday (a business day).\n10.3\nExample 2\nWhere the document is left in a numbered box at the DX on a Friday (a business day), the day of deemed service is the following Monday (a business day).\n10.4\nExample 3\nWhere the document is sent by fax on a Saturday and the transmission of that fax is completed by 4.30p.m. on that day, the day of deemed service is the following Monday (a business day).\n10.5\nExample 4",

Proceedings for divorce or maintenance and proceedings in the Family Courts generally are subject to special rules as to service which are explained in a practice direction issued by the Senior District Judge of the Principal Registry on 26 June 1979.\n3.\nIn this Annex, the person wishing to effect service is referred to as the ‘claimant’ and the member of the regular forces to be served is referred to as ‘the member’; the expression ‘overseas’ means outside the United Kingdom.\nTo the top\nEnquiries as to address\n4.\nAs a first step, the claimant’s legal representative will need to find out where the member is serving, if this is not already known. For this purpose the claimant’s legal representative should write to the appropriate officer of the Ministry of Defence as specified in paragraph 10 below.\n5.\nThe letter of enquiry should in every case show that the writer is a legal representative and that the enquiry is made solely with a view to the service of legal documents in civil proceedings.\n6.\nIn all cases the letter must give the full name, service number, rank or rate, and Ship, Arm or Trade, Regiment or Corps and Unit or as much of this information as is available. Failure to quote the service number and the rank or rate may result either in failure to identify the member or in considerable delay.\n7.\nThe letter must contain an undertaking by the legal representative that, if the address is given, it will be used solely for the purpose of issuing and serving documents in the proceedings and that so far as is possible the legal representative will disclose the address only to the court and not to the claimant or to any other person or body. A legal representative in the service of a public authority or private company must undertake that the address will be used solely for the purpose of issuing and serving documents in the proceedings and that the address will not be disclosed so far as is possible to any other part of the legal representative’s employing organisation or to any other person but only to the court. Normally on receipt of the required information and undertaking the appropriate office will give the service address.\n8.\nIf the legal representative does not give the undertaking, the only information that will be given is whether the member is at that time serving in England or Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or overseas.\n9.\nIt should be noted that a member’s address which ends with a British Forces Post Office address and reference (BFPO) will nearly always indicate that the member is serving overseas.\n10.\nThe letter of enquiry should be addressed as follows –\n(a) Royal Navy and Royal Marine Officers, Ratings and Other Ranks\nDirector Naval Personnel Fleet Headquarters MP 3.1 Leach Building Whale Island Portsmouth Hampshire PO2 8BY\nArmy Officers and other Ranks –\nArmy Personnel Centre Disclosures 1 MP 520 Kentigern House 65 Brown Street Glasgow G2 8EX\nRoyal Air Force Officers and Other Ranks –\nManning 22E RAF Disclosures Room 221B Trenchard Hall RAF Cranwell Sleaford Lincolnshire NG34 8HB\nTo the top\nAssistance in serving documents on members\n11.\nOnce the claimant’s legal representative has ascertained the member’s address, the legal representative may use that address as the address for service by post, in cases where this method of service is allowed by the Civil Procedure Rules. There are, however, some situations in which service of the proceedings, whether in the High Court or in the county court, must be effected personally; in these cases an appointment will have to be sought, through the Commanding Officer of the Unit, Establishment or Ship concerned, for the purpose of effecting service. The procedure for obtaining an appointment is described below, and it applies whether personal service is to be effected by the claimant’s legal representative or the legal representative’s agent or by a court bailiff, or, in the case of proceedings served overseas (with the leave of the court) through the British Consul or the foreign judicial authority.\n12.\nThe procedure for obtaining an appointment to effect personal service is by application to the Commanding Officer of the Unit, Establishment or Ship in which the member is serving. The Commanding Officer may grant permission for the document server to enter the Unit, Establishment or Ship but if this is not appropriate the Commanding Officer may offer arrangements for the member to attend at a place in the vicinity of the Unit, Establishment or Ship in order that the member may be served. If suitable arrangements cannot be made the legal representative will have evidence that personal service is impracticable, which may be useful in an application for service by an alternative method or at an alternative place.\nTo the top\nGeneral\n13.\nSubject to the procedure outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12, there are no special arrangements to assist in the service of legal documents when a member is outside the United Kingdom. The appropriate office will, however, give an approximate date when the member is likely to return to the United Kingdom.\n14.",

The Commanding Officer may grant permission for the document server to enter the Unit, Establishment or Ship but if this is not appropriate the Commanding Officer may offer arrangements for the member to attend at a place in the vicinity of the Unit, Establishment or Ship in order that the member may be served. If suitable arrangements cannot be made the legal representative will have evidence that personal service is impracticable, which may be useful in an application for service by an alternative method or at an alternative place.\nTo the top\nGeneral\n13.\nSubject to the procedure outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12, there are no special arrangements to assist in the service of legal documents when a member is outside the United Kingdom. The appropriate office will, however, give an approximate date when the member is likely to return to the United Kingdom.\n14.\nIt sometimes happens that a member has left the regular forces by the time an enquiry as to address is made. If the claimant’s legal representative confirms that the proceedings result from an occurrence when the member was in the regular forces and the legal representative gives the undertaking referred to in paragraph 7, the last known private address after discharge will normally be provided. In no other case, however, will the Ministry of Defence disclose the private address of a member of the regular forces.\nTo the top\nService on Members of United States Air Force\n15.\nIn addition to the information contained in the memorandum of 26 July 1979, and after some doubts having been expressed as to the correct procedure to be followed by persons having civil claims against members of the United States Air Force in England and Wales, the Lord Chancellor’s Office (as it was then) issued the following notes for guidance with the approval of the appropriate United States authorities.\n16.\nInstructions have been issued by the United States authorities to the commanding officers of all their units in England and Wales that every facility is to be given for the service of documents in civil proceedings on members of the United States Air Force. The proper course to be followed by a creditor or other person having a claim against a member of the United States Air Force is for that person to communicate with the commanding officer or, where the unit concerned has a legal officer, with the legal officer of the defendant’s unit requesting the provision of facilities for the service of documents on the defendant. It is not possible for the United States authorities to act as arbitrators when a civil claim is made against a member of their forces. It is, therefore, essential that the claim should either be admitted by the defendant or judgment should be obtained on it, whether in the High Court or a county court. If a claim has been admitted or judgment has been obtained and the claimant has failed to obtain satisfaction within a reasonable period, the claimant’s proper course is then to write to: Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Headquarters, Third Air Force, R.A.F. Mildenhall, Suffolk, enclosing a copy of the defendant’s written admission of the claim or, as the case may be, a copy of the judgment. Steps will then be taken by the Staff Judge Advocate to ensure that the matter is brought to the defendant’s attention with a view to prompt satisfaction of the claim.\nTo the top",

      "pageContent": "General\n1. Subject to the following provisions of this practice direction, proceedings where both the High Court and the County Court have jurisdiction may be started in the High Court or in the County Court.\nWhere to start proceedings\n2.1 Proceedings (whether for damages or for a specified sum) may only be started in the High Court if the value of the claim is more than £100,000.\n2.2 Proceedings which include a claim for damages in respect of personal injuries may only be started in the High Court if the value of the claim is £50,000 or more (paragraph 9 of the High Court and County Courts Jurisdiction Order 1991 (S.I. 1991/724 as amended) describes how the value of a claim is to be determined).\n2.3 A claim must be issued in the High Court or the County Court if an enactment so requires.\n2.4 Subject to paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above, a claim should be started in the High Court if by reason of—\n(1) the financial value of the claim and the amount in dispute, and/or\n(2) the complexity of the facts, legal issues, remedies or procedures involved,and/or\n(3) the importance of the outcome of the claim to the public in general,the claimant believes that the claim ought to be dealt with by a High Court judge.\n(CPR Part 30 and Practice Direction 30 contain provisions relating to the transfer to the County Court of proceedings started in the High Court and vice-versa.)\n2.5 (1) A claim in the County Court under Part 7 may be made at any County Court hearing centre, unless any enactment, rule or practice direction provides otherwise.\n(2) If a claim which is required to be made at a particular County Court hearing centre is made at the wrong hearing centre, a court officer will send the claim to the correct hearing centre before it is issued.\n2.6 A claim relating to Business and Property work (which includes any of the matters specified in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Senior Courts Act 1981) and which includes any work under the jurisdiction of the Business and Property Courts, may, subject to any enactment, rule or practice direction, be dealt with in the High Court or in the County Court. The claim form should, if issued in the High Court, be marked in the top right hand corner ‘Business and Property Courts’ and, if issued in the County Court, be marked ‘Business and Property work’ (except, in the County Court, for those areas listed as exceptions in paragraph 4.2 of Practice Direction 57AA (Business and Property Courts).\n(For the equity jurisdiction of the County Court, see section 23 of the County Courts Act 1984.)\n2.7 A claim relating to any of the matters specified in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Senior Courts Act 1981 must be dealt with in the High Court and will be assigned to the King’s Bench Division.\n2.8 Practice directions applying to particular types of proceedings, or to proceedings in particular courts, will contain provisions relating to the commencement and conduct of those proceedings.\n2.9 The following proceedings may not be started in the County Court unless the parties have agreed otherwise in writing—\n(1) a claim for damages or other remedy for libel or slander, and\n(2) a claim in which the title to any toll, fair, market or franchise is in question.\n2.10\n(1) Subject to paragraph 2.9, a claim relating to media and communications work (which includes any work which would fall within the jurisdiction of the Media and Communications List if issued in the High Court) may be started in the County Court or High Court; and paragraph 2.1 shall not apply to such a claim.\n(2) Such a claim should be started in the High Court if, by reason of the factors set out in paragraph 2.4(1) to (3), the claimant believes that the claim ought to be dealt with by a High Court judge.\n(3) If a claimant starts such a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay.\n2.11\n(1) The normal rules apply in deciding in which court and specialist list a claim that includes issues under the Human Rights Act 1998 should be started. They also apply in deciding which procedure to use to start the claim; this Part or CPR Part 8 or CPR Part 54 (judicial review).\n(2) The exception is a claim for damages in respect of a judicial act, which should be started in the High Court. If the claim is made in a notice of appeal then it will be dealt with according to the normal rules governing where that appeal is heard.\n(The County Court cannot make a declaration of incompatibility in accordance with section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Legislation may direct that such a claim is to be brought before a specified tribunal.)\nThe claim form\n3.1 A claimant must use form N1 to start a claim under Part 7.\n3.2 Other practice directions may require other forms to be used to start types of proceedings, or proceedings in particular courts.\n3.3 Where a claim form to be served out of the jurisdiction is one which the court has power to deal with under—\n(a) the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; and\n(b) the Judgments Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters),the claim form must, under rule 6.34, be filed and served with the notice referred to in that rule and paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 6B.\n3.4 If a claim for damages or for an unspecified sum is started in the High Court, the claim form must—\n(1) state that the claimant expects to recover more than £100,000 (or £50,000 or more if the claim is for personal injuries); or\n(2) state that some enactment provides that the claim may only be started in the High Court and specify that enactment; or\n(3) state that the claim is to be in one of the specialist High Court lists (see CPR Parts 49 and 58–62) and specify that list.\n3.5 If a claim for damages for personal injuries is started in the County Court, the claim form must state whether or not the claimant expects to recover more than £1000 in respect of pain, suffering and loss of amenity.\n3.6 If a claim for housing disrepair which includes a claim for an order requiring repairs or other work to be carried out by the landlord is started in the County Court, the claim form must state—\n(1) whether or not the cost of the repairs or other work is estimated to be more than £1000, and\n(2) whether or not the claimant expects to recover more than £1000 in respect of any claim for damages.\nIf either of the amounts mentioned in (1) and (2) is more than £1000, the small claims track will not be the normal track for that claim.\nTitle of proceedings\n4.1 The claim form and every other statement of case, must be headed with the title of the proceedings. The title should state—\n(1) the identifying number given to the proceedings;\n(2) the court or Division in which they are proceeding;\n(3) the full name of each party;\n(4) each party’s status in the proceedings (i.e. claimant/defendant).\n(Paragraph 2.4 of Practice Direction 16 sets out what is meant by a full name in respect of each type of claimant.)\n4.2 Where there is more than one claimant and/or more than one defendant, the parties should be described in the title as follows—\n1.  [Name of first claimant]2.  [Name of second claimant, etc]and1.  [Name of first defendant]2.  [Name of second defendant, etc]\nStarting a Part 7 Claim in the County Court\n5.1 (1) Subject to subparagraph (2), if a claim—\n(a) is started in the County Court under Part 7;\n(b) is a claim only for an amount of money, whether specified or unspecified; and\n(c) is not a claim for which special procedures are provided in the Civil Procedure Rules or practice directions, form N1 must be sent to: Civil National Business Centre, St Katharine’s House, 21-27 St Katharine’s Street, Northampton, NN1 2LH, DX 702885 Northampton 7.",

The title should state—\n(1) the identifying number given to the proceedings;\n(2) the court or Division in which they are proceeding;\n(3) the full name of each party;\n(4) each party’s status in the proceedings (i.e. claimant/defendant).\n(Paragraph 2.4 of Practice Direction 16 sets out what is meant by a full name in respect of each type of claimant.)\n4.2 Where there is more than one claimant and/or more than one defendant, the parties should be described in the title as follows—\n1.  [Name of first claimant]2.  [Name of second claimant, etc]and1.  [Name of first defendant]2.  [Name of second defendant, etc]\nStarting a Part 7 Claim in the County Court\n5.1 (1) Subject to subparagraph (2), if a claim—\n(a) is started in the County Court under Part 7;\n(b) is a claim only for an amount of money, whether specified or unspecified; and\n(c) is not a claim for which special procedures are provided in the Civil Procedure Rules or practice directions, form N1 must be sent to: Civil National Business Centre, St Katharine’s House, 21-27 St Katharine’s Street, Northampton, NN1 2LH, DX 702885 Northampton 7.\n(2) For the purpose of this practice direction, the procedure in Practice Direction 49D is not a special procedure.\n5.2 In proceedings referred to in paragraph 4A.1, the claimant must specify the preferred hearing centre on form N1.\nStart of proceedings\n6.1 Proceedings are started when the court issues a claim form at the request of the claimant (see rule 7.2) but where the claim form as issued was received in the court office on a date earlier than the date on which it was issued by the court, the claim is “brought” for the purposes of the Limitation Act 1980 and any other relevant statute on that earlier date.\n6.2 The date on which the claim form was received by the court will be recorded by a date stamp either on the claim form held on the court file or on the letter that accompanied the claim form when it was received by the court.\n6.3 An enquiry about the date on which the claim form was received by the court should be directed to a court officer.\n6.4 Parties proposing to start a claim which is approaching the expiry of the limitation period should recognise the potential importance of establishing the date the claim form was received by the court and should themselves make arrangements to record the date.\n6.5 Where a person seeks to start proceedings against the estate of a deceased defendant where probate or letters of administration have not been granted, the claimant should issue the claim against “the personal representatives of A.B. deceased”. The claimant should then, before the expiry of the period for service of the claim form, apply to the court for the appointment of a person to represent the estate of the deceased.\nClaims by and against partnerships within the jurisdiction\n7.1 Paragraphs 7 and 8 apply to claims that are brought by or against two or more persons who—\n(1) were business partners; and\n(2) carried on that partnership business within the jurisdiction, at the time when the cause of action accrued.\n7.2 For the purposes of this paragraph, “partners” includes persons claiming to be entitled as partners and persons alleged to be partners.\n7.3 Where that partnership has a name, unless it is inappropriate to do so, claims must be brought in or against the name under which that partnership carried on business at the time the cause of action accrued.\nPartnership membership statements\n8.1 In this paragraph a ‘partnership membership statement’ is a written statement of the names and last known places of residence of all the persons who were partners in the partnership at the time when the cause of action accrued, being the date specified for this purpose in accordance with paragraph 8.3.\n8.2 If the partners are requested to provide a copy of a partnership membership statement by any party to a claim, the partners must do so within 14 days of receipt of the request.\n8.3 In that request the party seeking a copy of a partnership membership statement must specify the date when the relevant cause of action accrued.\n(Signing of the acknowledgment of service in the case of a partnership is dealt with in CPR rule 10.5(5).)\nPersons carrying on business in another name\n9.1 This paragraph applies where—\n(1) a claim is brought against an individual;\n(2) that individual carries on a business within the jurisdiction (even if not personally within the jurisdiction); and\n(3) that business is carried on in a name other than that individual’s own name (“the business name”).\n9.2 The claim may be brought against the business name as if it were the name of a partnership.\nStatement of truth\n10.1 The form of a statement of truth is specified in paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 22.\n10.2 Attention is drawn to rule 32.14 which sets out the consequences of verifying a statement of case containing a false statement without an honest belief in its truth.\nExtension of time\n11.1 An application under rule 7.6 (for an extension of time for serving a claim form under rule 7.6(1)) must be made in accordance with Part 23 and supported by evidence.\n11.2 The evidence should state—\n(1) all the circumstances relied on,\n(2) the date of issue of the claim,\n(3) the expiry date of any rule 7.6 extension, and\n(4) a full explanation as to why the claim has not been served.\n(For information regarding (1) written evidence see Part 32 and Practice Direction 32 and (2) service of the claim form see Part 6 and Practice Directions 6A and 6B.)\nTo the top",
